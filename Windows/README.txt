    There's a bit of "loading time" once after game is launched. Please be patient.
    Fluid very rough why?
        I tried to combine SPH and unity's physics engine. So I can have my fluid to be bound by
        World's objects. 
        However I ended up with pieces of broken "try hard" SPH.

The following is my excuse for this "rather broken demo"

        I realized I need to understand Navier Strok first in order to understand SPH,
        then I need to understand unity's physics system deeper to combine both.
        I plan to study Navier Stroke equation more thoughly then try to understand SPH.
        I "really" want to do fluid properly and I "really" need to study math to do so. So I just finished this as quick as possible.
        So,.... yeah.
